# GMU_Microfluidic_Gradient_Image_Processing
Took place the summer of 2024. Worked with Dr. Moran at GMU to create gradients within small hydrogels.
Gradients were created with rhodamine dye. Pictures were taken under a microscope. Laws of spectroscopy were applied to find effectiveness of gradient creating methods. 
The following MATLAB code was used for image processing to verify the existance of a gradient within pictures taken.
